# [1137. N-th Tribonacci Number][link] (Easy)

[link]: https://leetcode.com/problems/n-th-tribonacci-number/

The Tribonacci sequence T is defined as follows:

T = 0, T = 1, T = 1, and T = T \+ T \+ T for n >= 0.

Given `n`, return the value of T.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 4
Output: 4
Explanation:
T_3 = 0 + 1 + 1 = 2
T_4 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 25
Output: 1389537
```

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= n <= 37`
- The answer is guaranteed to fit within a 32-bit integer, ie. `answer <= 2^31 - 1`.
